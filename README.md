## LINEAR REGRESSION USING SALINITY TO PREDICT TEMPERATURE OF WATER

VAC task

Name: Nithin Shanmugam V

TASK Assigned:

1. Choose a problem statement in any field 
2. Collect data with appropriate features for the problem statement 
3. Data collection can be done on your own depending on the problem statement or you can also use the dataset available open source 
4. Import and pre-process the data 
5. Perform Linear Regression by choosing appropriate variables 
6. Plot graphs wherever necessary and provide performance metric


Problem statement choosed: 
Finding a relationship between water salinity & water temperature. Trying to find whether can we predict the water temperature based on salinity.

Dataset Used: CalCOFI dataset
